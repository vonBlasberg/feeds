Drawing from the theory of political ideology-as-motivated cognition, across multiple pre-registered field studies, we found that employees who were more liberal (vs. conservative) reported higher engagement in all three modalities. We also examined whether contextual affordances amplified the liberalism effect. Specifically, we tested whether personal accountability for diversity, colleague diversity, and organizational ideology directed liberals towards greater engagement in self, relational, and organizational work, respectively. As hypothesized, liberals reported a higher engagement in organizational ally work in more ideologically liberal organizations. However, the hypothesized effects of personal accountability were not supported. Notably, personal accountability had a positive effect on self ally work among more conservative leaning employees. The moderating effects of colleague diversity were also mixed across the studies. Highlighting both the plurality and politics of ally work, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our finding</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732296},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.1197\" title=\"Signaling Diversity Debt: Startup Gender Composition and the Gender Gap in Joiners’ Interest \" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.1197\">Signaling Diversity Debt: Startup Gender Composition and the Gender Gap in Joiners’ Interest </a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Engel%2C+Yuval\" title=\"Yuval Engel\"><span>Yuval Engel</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Lewis%2C+Trey\" title=\"Trey Lewis\"><span>Trey Lewis</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Cardon%2C+Melissa+S\" title=\"Melissa S.

We argue that, even among joiners, women are less interested than men in applying to startup jobs and that this gender gap is associated with differential reactions to information about the gender composition of prospective employers. We analyze unique field data obtained from a job-matching mobile-application platform for startups, finding the hypothesized gender gap and showing that women, but not men, are sensitive to information about organizational gender composition, especially for startups signaling diversity debt – i.e., no or only a token representation of women. A preregistered experiment further reveals that women’s identity threat concerns mediate these effects. Gender disparities in startups are reproduced in a vicious cycle as existing underrepresentation deters women from applying. Our findings have implications for research and practice concerning joiners, the underrepresentation of women in entrepreneurship, and startups’ ability to shape the gender composition of their applicant pools.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732299},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0430\" title=\"Learning Down to Train Up: Mentors Are More Effective When They Value Insights from Below\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.0430\">Learning Down to Train Up: Mentors Are More Effective When They Value Insights from Below</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Zhang%2C+Ting\" title=\"Ting Zhang\"><span>Ting Zhang</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Wang%2C+Dan+J\" title=\"Dan J.

To understand what motivates mentors to overcome this barrier and more fully engage with their mentees, we introduce a new construct, learning direction, which captures the beliefs people have about which individuals within a hierarchy—upward, lateral, or downward—are valuable sources of knowledge. Although most mentors believe knowledge resides higher up in hierarchies, the current research demonstrates mentors are more engaged and effective when they value insights from below. Our first three studies found that downward learning predicted mentor engagement (Study 1) because downward learning-directed mentors viewed mentoring as a worthwhile opportunity for their own learning (Studies 2A-B). A field study examined downstream consequences on mentees’ learning outcomes, finding that downward learning-directed mentors trained more hireable mentees (Study 3). A final experiment established causality while also demonstrating that learning direction is open to intervention: reflecting on a downward learning experience increased mentor engagement, which enhanced the mentorship experience for their mentees (Study 4). We extend theories on learning orientation to learning direction and demonstrate that beliefs about the hierarchical sources of learning are critical to successful mentoring.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732299},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.1227\" title=\"When People Build Networks That Hurt Their Performance: Structural Holes, Cognitive Style, and the Unintended Consequences of Person-Network Fit\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.1227\">When People Build Networks That Hurt Their Performance: Structural Holes, Cognitive Style, and the Unintended Consequences of Person-Network Fit</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Carnabuci%2C+Gianluca\" title=\"Gianluca Carnabuci\"><span>Gianluca Carnabuci</span></a></li> and <li><a href=\"/author/Quintane%2C+Eric\" title=\"Eric Quintane\"><span>Eric Quintane</span></a></li></ul><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><span>Published Online:</span>22 September 2022</li></ul><div class=\"toc-item__footer\"><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><a title=\"Abstract\" href=\"/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2021.1227\"><span>Abstract</span><i class=\"icon icon-abstract\"></i></a></li><li><a title=\"PDF/EPUB\" href=\"/doi/reader/10.5465/amj.2021.1227\"><span>PDF/EPUB</span><i class=\"icon icon-file-pdf\"></i></a></li></ul><div class=\"accordion\"><a href=\"#\" title=\"Preview Abstract\" class=\"accordion__control\"><i class=\"icon-section_arrow_d\"></i>Preview Abstract</a><div class=\"accordion__content toc-item__abstract\" style=\"display: none;\">Extant research shows that individual cognitive style affects whether employees benefit most from a brokering or a dense network. But do people build the network structure in which they perform best? We address this question by advancing a novel 2-stage explanatory model that explicitly disentangles the network formation process from its performance effects. We hypothesize that Adaptors (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on implementable solutions through commonly accepted and well-defined approaches) perform best when their network spans structural holes. Yet, these same individuals systematically forego opportunities to build relations across structural holes. By contrast, Innovators (i.e., individuals inclined to focus on envisioning creative solutions that break away with established approaches) draw no or even negative performance returns from structural holes. Nevertheless, their inclination is to build ever-new bridging relations. We test and find support for this counterintuitive hypothesis through a randomized longitudinal field experiment enabling us to disentangle empirically both stages of our theorized process model. Our findings help illuminate why people may build networks that hurt their performance, shed a new light on the role of individual cognitive style in shaping network advantage, and bear concrete implications for organizations aiming to leverage networks to enhance employees’ performance.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732300},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.1358\" title=\"Wearing Your Worth at Work: The Consequences of Employees’ Daily Clothing Choices\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.1358\">Wearing Your Worth at Work: The Consequences of Employees’ Daily Clothing Choices</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Kim%2C+Joseph+K\" title=\"Joseph K.

Despite the universal necessity of wearing clothes and the fact that employees make decisions about this daily, organizational scholars have not yet addressed this question. We integrated sociometer and enclothed cognition theories to propose that aspects of clothing—their aesthetics, conformity, and uniqueness—hold symbolic meanings that have implications for employees’ state self-esteem and subsequent task and relational behaviors (i.e., goal progress, social avoidance). We first provide evidence for the nature of the symbolic meanings associated with these three dimensions of work clothing in a set of within-person experimental studies. Then, the results of a 10-day field study of employees from four organizations generally supported our predictions, showing that daily clothing aesthetics and uniqueness had effects on state self-esteem and downstream behavioral consequences. The effects of daily clothing conformity emerged under the condition of greater interaction frequency with others in the workplace. Our manuscript contributes to both major theories from which we draw and further offers theoretical and practical contributions to the literature on organizational clothing.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732303},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0218\" title=\"Reaching for the Stars: How Gender Influences the Formation of High-Status Collaboration Ties\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.0218\">Reaching for the Stars: How Gender Influences the Formation of High-Status Collaboration Ties</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Rua-Gomez%2C+Carla\" title=\"Carla Rua-Gomez\"><span>Carla Rua-Gomez</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Carnabuci%2C+Gianluca\" title=\"Gianluca Carnabuci\"><span>Gianluca Carnabuci</span></a></li> and <li><a href=\"/author/Goossen%2C+Martin+C\" title=\"Martin C.

Extending this line of research, we examine how two structural factors – geographic and network proximity – affect men’s and women’s chances of forming high-status connections. Using data on the formation of collaboration ties with star scientists within the R&amp;D laboratories of the forty-two largest pharmaceutical companies between 1985 and 2010, we show that women who are geographically co-located with a “star” colleague are less likely to form a tie with that colleague than male peers who are similarly co-located, and this difference persists irrespective of the star’s gender. Conversely, women benefit more than men do from network proximity, as indicated by the presence of common third-party ties, and this difference widens if the star colleague is also a woman. By illuminating how geographic and network proximity affect the chances of forming high-status connections differently for women than for men, our study goes beyond the notion that women have reduced access to workplace social capital and expands consideration to the structural factors that underpin – amplify or reduce – that disadvantage.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732303},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0273\" title=\"The Benefits and Burdens of Work Moralization on Creativity\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.0273\">The Benefits and Burdens of Work Moralization on Creativity</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Kundro%2C+Timothy+G\" title=\"Timothy G Kundro\"><span>Timothy G Kundro</span></a></li></ul><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><span>Published Online:</span>15 August 2022</li></ul><div class=\"toc-item__footer\"><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><a title=\"Abstract\" href=\"/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2021.0273\"><span>Abstract</span><i class=\"icon icon-abstract\"></i></a></li><li><a title=\"PDF/EPUB\" href=\"/doi/reader/10.5465/amj.2021.0273\"><span>PDF/EPUB</span><i class=\"icon icon-file-pdf\"></i></a></li></ul><div class=\"accordion\"><a href=\"#\" title=\"Preview Abstract\" class=\"accordion__control\"><i class=\"icon-section_arrow_d\"></i>Preview Abstract</a><div class=\"accordion__content toc-item__abstract\" style=\"display: none;\">Although morality has long been considered an important and integral element of organizational life for employees, current research suggests that moral considerations will reduce creativity. However, emerging evidence hints that morality may not always be a burden and instead could spark creativity. In this paper, I develop a model that investigates how work moralization—or the degree to which individuals integrate moral considerations into their work tasks—influences employee creativity. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, I argue that work moralization can lead to prevention-focused cognitions—namely moral rumination—which impair and redirect the cognitive resources needed for creativity. However, I also posit that work moralization can lead to promotion-focused cognitions—namely cognitive flexibility—leading employees to adopt cognitive approaches that increase creativity. Moreover, integrating research on value congruence, I suggest that work moralizers are the least likely to ruminate—and the most likely to become cognitively flexible—when they perceive that their values are aligned with those of their organization, which ultimately fosters higher levels of creativity. I test my theoretical model with two field studies and an immersive pre-registered experiment. This research challenges the consensus that moral considerations will generally have a negative impact on creativity and offers important contributions to research on organizational ethics and creativity.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732304},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2019.0405\" title=\"Does Job Satisfaction Rise and Fall with the Economy?

Finally, Study 3 (N = 512) uses an experimental design and finds that when the economy falters, alternative jobs become less salient, which mediates the relationship between economic conditions and job satisfaction.

Through an inductive process study, we examined the development of the market for genomic (DNA) data – an emergent digital market plagued by moral conflicts over privacy and ownership. Drawing on interview, archival and observational data, we analyzed how rules for exchanging genomic data emerged, and how entrepreneurial technology-development moves influenced those rules. Our findings revealed a four-step process, which we call the technological entrainment of moral issues, involving the progressive synchronization of framings, technical policies, technologies (software), exchange platforms, and market participant behaviors. This process baked particular moral stances on privacy and ownership into technological designs, which then dictated the rules market participants were required to follow to engage in exchange. We conclude that when markets are digital, technology processes central to exchange end up controlling many moral aspects of exchange. Our study contributes to theories of morally contentious markets and cultural/institutional entrepreneurship, by illuminating how those theories can incorporate material (not only symbolic) aspects of technology processes and better explain the emerging moral order within the fast-expanding realm of digital markets.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732321},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2019.1411\" title=\"Tempering Temperance?

We develop a contingency framework explaining how their success depends on the internal fit between movements’ private and public politics strategies with the tactics of mass and elite mobilization. We also highlight the importance of how these tactics fit with external conditions like the cognitive legitimacy of the industry and industry countermobilization. When movements rely on a private politics strategy to condemn an industry in the eyes of the public, social movement mass will be decisive. Alternatively, when movements use a public politics strategy to push for regulatory intervention, the mobilization of elites is crucial. We develop our understanding of external contingency factors by exploring how cognitive legitimacy residuals from local ancestral populations affect both mass-driven private politics and elite-driven public politics, and how national-level industry countermobilization efforts affect elite-driven public politics strategies. We test these ideas in a historical study of the Scottish whisky distilling industry during the rise of temperance movements (1823-1921).

However, such predictions are grounded primarily in the Global North, emphasizing role pairings such as ‘work-family’ and hybrid ‘work-work.’ Comparatively, the Global South is characterized by a relative lack of public services that creates a highly contrasted, highly salient, and yet understudied role pairing – ‘work-community.’ Additionally, the socioeconomic features of the Global South (e.g., dense and overlapping community networks, financial poverty) call into question whether existing predictions surrounding boundary strength are likely to hold. We conducted a qualitative study of 73 Tanzanian participants who had both a self-employed work role and a family planning counsellor community role. We found that highly contrasted roles can be simultaneously perceived as both incompatible and compatible. Specifically, the boundaries we observed were neither uniformly strong nor weak, but rather of asymmetric strength: strong when a social interaction was anchored in the community role, but weak when anchored in the work role. The specific role contrasts we identify, and the importance of role anchoring we observe, have important implications for role theory and literature on boundary setting more broadly.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732323},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0245\" title=\"Communication Miscalibration: The Price Leaders Pay for Not Sharing Enough\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.0245\">Communication Miscalibration: The Price Leaders Pay for Not Sharing Enough</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Flynn%2C+Francis+J\" title=\"Francis J Flynn\"><span>Francis J Flynn</span></a></li> and <li><a href=\"/author/Lide%2C+Chelsea+R\" title=\"Chelsea R Lide\"><span>Chelsea R Lide</span></a></li></ul><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><span>Published Online:</span>25 July 2022</li></ul><div class=\"toc-item__footer\"><ul class=\"rlist--inline separator toc-item__detail\"><li><a title=\"Abstract\" href=\"/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2021.0245\"><span>Abstract</span><i class=\"icon icon-abstract\"></i></a></li><li><a title=\"PDF/EPUB\" href=\"/doi/reader/10.5465/amj.2021.0245\"><span>PDF/EPUB</span><i class=\"icon icon-file-pdf\"></i></a></li></ul><div class=\"accordion\"><a href=\"#\" title=\"Preview Abstract\" class=\"accordion__control\"><i class=\"icon-section_arrow_d\"></i>Preview Abstract</a><div class=\"accordion__content toc-item__abstract\" style=\"display: none;\">Leaders may be seen by their followers as miscalibrating the quantity of their communication—sharing too much or too little. We propose that leaders are more likely to be seen as under-communicating than over-communicating, even though under-communication is more heavily penalized. In Study 1a, we examine 2,717 qualitative comments from archived leadership assessments and find that leaders are nearly ten times as likely to be criticized for under-communicating than over-communicating. In Study 1b, we obtain further evidence of this bias using a representative sample of U.S. adults. In Study 2, we manipulate communication (mis)calibration, showing that leaders who under-communicate are viewed as less qualified for a leadership role because they are viewed as less empathic. In Study 3, we use separate measures of employee perceptions of their manager’s communication as well as their preferences. When there is a lack of congruence between perceived and preferred communication, employees judge their leaders as lacking empathy and, in turn, leadership ability.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732324},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.1308\" title=\"Free to Be Me?

We draw from interviews with 25 transgender employees conducted at four points in time over a two-year period as they initiate, perform, and continue their gender transition. Contributing to the literature on authenticity and identity transitions, our findings challenge the assumptions that individuals know how to express an authentic self and that authenticity has an endpoint by pointing to the evolving and relational nature of authenticity that involves a trial-and-error approach in which transgender individuals learn to become authentic as they engage in various forms of gender performativity. Further, we position authenticity as a continuum, as individuals may temper their gender expression to elicit acceptance and express a gender that feels “authentic enough” as they contend with the impact of prevailing gender norms and expectations in the workplace. Finally, the findings suggest that the identity transition process evolves in a non-linear way and involves a dynamic interplay between the desire to express one’s gender in a way that feels authentic and the desire to feel accepted by others. </div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732325},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0174\" title=\"Signaling Legitimacy: Why Mixed-Gender Coalitions Outperform Single-Gender Coalitions in Advocating for Gender Equity\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.0174\">Signaling Legitimacy: Why Mixed-Gender Coalitions Outperform Single-Gender Coalitions in Advocating for Gender Equity</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Hussain%2C+Insiya\" title=\"Insiya Hussain\"><span>Insiya Hussain</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Tangirala%2C+Subrahmaniam\" title=\"Subrahmaniam Tangirala\"><span>Subrahmaniam Tangirala</span></a></li> and <li><a href=\"/author/Sherf%2C+Elad+N\" title=\"Elad N.

Such coalition-based advocacy is largely driven by women, which has led to debate about whether men’s involvement as allies can help. Integrating literatures on signaling and legitimacy, we propose that the demographic composition of a gender equity advocacy coalition matters: Men-only groups lack <i>coalition legitimacy</i>, or the perception that they are the “right” spokespersons for gender equity issues, whereas women-only groups struggle to convey <i>issue legitimacy</i>, or the perception that gender equity is of strategic importance within business organizations. By contrast, mixed-gender coalitions signal <i>both</i> forms of legitimacy, and are thus uniquely effective. We demonstrate these effects over three studies: managers reporting on advocacy coalitions comprising their colleagues (Study 1), an audio-based study showing that the proposed effects are unique for gender equity issues (Study 2), and a stimulus sampling study involving multiple policy proposals (Study 3). Our findings highlight the different forms of legitimacy that women and men bring to the table when selling gender equity issues. We discuss implications for who should be recruited to gender equity advocacy coalitions, and why.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732327},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.1093\" title=\"How Organizations Influence Interpersonal Trust Repair: The Case of a French Antiterrorist Unit \" id=\"10.5465/amj.2020.1093\">How Organizations Influence Interpersonal Trust Repair: The Case of a French Antiterrorist Unit </a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Sala%2C+Gabriel+R\" title=\"Gabriel R.

However, these are the very same task conditions were trust is most fragile and in need of repair. As a result, organizations may wish to intervene in repairing interpersonal trust among its members. Through an inductive qualitative study of a French anti-terrorist unit, we move beyond dyadic treatments of interpersonal trust repair to theorize a model that elucidates the organizational practices that can be used to guide members through the trust repair process. We also induce core mechanisms, such as establishing trust violation rules and providing trust templates, that explain why these organizational practices work to repair interpersonal trust. We suggest how this organizationally-directed trust repair process can lead to the full, partial or failure of trust repair for trust violators, with consequences on whether and how these violators may be reintegrated into the organization. We conclude by discussing the contributions of our research on trust repair, as well as on how organizations treat organizational wrongdoers; and suggest several avenues for future research.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732328},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.1176\" title=\"The Glass Wall and the Gendered Evaluation of Role Expansion in Freelancing Careers\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2020.1176\">The Glass Wall and the Gendered Evaluation of Role Expansion in Freelancing Careers</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Lee%2C+Yonghoon+G\" title=\"Yonghoon G.

Extant literature proposed that progressive role expansion—starting one’s career specialized in a single work role and later expanding into new work roles—would be helpful to navigate through such a challenge. However, we propose that when women engage in lateral role expansion within professional careers, they face a glass wall, an invisible barrier that limits their work opportunities due to a gendered evaluation of role expansion. Specifically, role expansion by female freelancers is seen as less agentic than by male freelancers, and such difference undermines the perceived competence and commitment of female freelancers. Across three studies using different methods (archival data and experiment), industries (music and film), and samples (Korean and American), we find female freelancers who expand into a new work role are seen as less agentic and have a lower chance of finding new work opportunities than men who expand. Although women who pursue careers outside of organizations may become unshackled from gender biases embedded within traditional organizational hierarchies, we suggest that they still face substantial obstacles in the new forms of work. </div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732329},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.1614\" title=\"“We Can’t Compete on Human Rights”: Creating Market-Protected Spaces to Institutionalize the Emerging Logic of Responsible Management \" id=\"10.5465/amj.2020.1614\">“We Can’t Compete on Human Rights”: Creating Market-Protected Spaces to Institutionalize the Emerging Logic of Responsible Management </a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Sch%C3%BC%C3%9Fler%2C+Elke+S\" title=\"Elke S.

Based on an in-depth qualitative study of how apparel MNCs have addressed labor standards violations since the deadly 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse, we show how CSR managers navigate the tension between the emerging responsible management logic and the highly institutionalized market logic, revealing how some go beyond accommodating responsible management within the market by prioritizing responsible management in market-protected spaces. We theorize the construction of market-protected spaces as a multilevel mechanism for institutionalizing an emerging logic in the context of a field dominated by the market logic via three forms of institutional work: restraining the jurisdiction of the market logic, infusing the responsible management logic with nonmarket elements, and maintaining market-protected spaces against resistance. A market-protected space is an institutionally bound space that suspends the dominance of the market logic on selected issues based on a binding regulatory infrastructure that allows prioritizing responsible management practices, unlike voluntary CSR. The concept of a market-protected space maps a path for policy makers, managers, and other actors interested in institutionalizing responsible management in the global economy.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732331},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2020.0017\" title=\"Distilling Authenticity: Materiality and Narratives in Canadian Distilleries' Authenticity Work\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2020.0017\">Distilling Authenticity: Materiality and Narratives in Canadian Distilleries' Authenticity Work</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Voronov%2C+Maxim\" title=\"Maxim Voronov\"><span>Maxim Voronov</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Foster%2C+William+M\" title=\"William M.

Accordingly, authenticity work, the organizational efforts to develop and sustain believable authenticity claims, has emerged as an important organizational practice. We examined the interplay of materiality and narratives underpinning producers’ authenticity work in the context of incumbent and micro-distilleries operating in the Canadian whisky industry. We found that producers’ material endowments, especially central product features, anchored what authenticity claims they could credibly narrate. Other material endowments, such as key people and architectural design, were used to reinforce the integrity of authenticity claims. Our study extends our understanding of authenticity as a valued organizational resource. First, we identify two mechanisms, anchoring and reinforcement, through which materiality both constrains and facilitates organizations’ authenticity narratives. Second, our research brings to the fore how audience members’ experiential closeness to producers colors their perceptions of authenticity, and we show how material artifacts can enhance such closeness. Third, our findings enrich the understanding of competitive value of authenticity in the context of strategy by unpacking how producers’ material endowments may constitute a resource or a liability.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732332},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.1022\" title=\"Rekindling the Fire and Stoking the Flames: How and When Workplace Interpersonal Capitalization Facilitates Pride and Knowledge Sharing at Work\" id=\"10.5465/amj.2021.1022\">Rekindling the Fire and Stoking the Flames: How and When Workplace Interpersonal Capitalization Facilitates Pride and Knowledge Sharing at Work</a></h5><ul class=\"rlist--inline loa\" aria-label=\"author\"><li><a href=\"/author/Watkins%2C+Trevor\" title=\"Trevor Watkins\"><span>Trevor Watkins</span></a></li>, <li><a href=\"/author/Kleshinski%2C+Catherine+E\" title=\"Catherine E.

However, individuals capitalize in the context of workplace relationships which serve instrumental functions, pointing to the possibility that the process of capitalization may at times be instrumental as well. In this paper, we integrate theory on capitalization with the social-functionalist model of emotions to develop a model that explains how workplace interpersonal capitalization serves the instrumental function of spurring knowledge sharing. We identify pride as a linking mechanism between workplace interpersonal capitalization and knowledge sharing, and we argue that experiencing pride is contingent on employees disclosing positive events that they attribute to their own efforts. We also identify perceived coworker responsiveness as a boundary condition qualifying the association between pride and knowledge sharing. A source- and time-separated field study and an experience sampling field experiment with a daily intervention provide support for our hypothesized model. Overall, our work broadens the concept of capitalization and contributes to the social-functionalist model of emotions. </div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732336},{"title":"undefined (Academy of Management Journal)","contents":"<div class=\"badges\"><span class=\"badge-type\">NO ACCESS</span></div><h5 class=\"issue-item__title\"><a href=\"/doi/10.5465/amj.2021.0175\" title=\"“Distinctive from What?

We argue that producers compete against prior and current competitors, as well as against their past selves. In the context of 153 artists active during a key period of the emergence of modern art (1905-1916), we use a convolutional neural network used in computer vision to extract feature vectors of artworks, and then measure quantitative distance of these artists’ works from canonical reference points. We find that artists are rewarded for distinctiveness from prior and current competitors and their past selves (up to a point).  However, the artists’ autonomy to differentiate themselves depends on their position in social structure, which we divide into the supply-side of artist-to-artist networks, and the demand side of artist-to-gallerist networks.  Artists with high or low supply-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors than do artists with middle supply-side status.  Artists with higher demand-side status receive higher rewards for distinctiveness from their own past, but lower rewards for distinctiveness from current competitors. These results show that peers strive to constrain each other to conform to positions of gravity within product space, and that market audiences deploy either higher or lower constraints on a producer’s identity depending on the reference point.</div></div></div>","retrieved":1668712732338}]}
